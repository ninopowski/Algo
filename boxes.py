# You have N boxes in your room which you want to carry to a different place.
# There are too many to carry in one trip, so you want to split them into several piles using the following algorithm:
# - if the current pile has at most M boxes, you can carry it as is,
# otherwise you split it into P parts as equally as possible
# (i.e. so that the sizes of the parts differ at most by 1) and
# apply the same algorithm to each of the parts.
# - If you're trying to split less than P boxes into P piles, discard resulting zero-sized piles (see example 2).
# Calculate the number of piles you'll get in the end.
# The only line of input contains three space-separated integers: N, M and P. 1 <= N <= 100, 1 <= M <= 5, 2 <= P <= 5.
#
# Example 1
# input
# 11 2 2
# output
# 7
# The sequence of pile splits you do is:
# 11 -> 6 + 5
# 6 -> 3 + 3
# 5 -> 3 + 2
# 3 -> 2 + 1 (applied to three piles of 3 boxes each)
# You end up with 4 piles of 2 boxes and 3 piles of 1 boxes, a total of 7 piles.
# Example 2
# input
# 3 2 5
# output
# 3
# You have to split a pile of 3 boxes into 5 parts, so you get 3 piles of 1 box and 2 empty piles which you discard.
